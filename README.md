## 📊 Overview
This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Blinkit's sales and inventory dataset using Python libraries. The objective is to uncover insights into sales performance, customer satisfaction, and inventory distribution using key performance indicators (KPIs) and data visualizations.

## ✅ Objectives

- Analyze overall and average sales performance.
- Identify the distribution of items and their average customer ratings.
- Visualize performance by item types, fat content, outlet characteristics, and location.
- Generate actionable insights to optimize business strategy and customer experience.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook  
- **Visualization Types:** Bar Chart, Donut Chart, Line Chart, Stacked Column Chart, Pie Chart, Funnel Map  

## 📦 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes information on products, their fat content, item type, outlet size and establishment year, and sales metrics across various store locations.

**Key Columns:**

- `Item_Type`, `Fat_Content`, `Item_Outlet_Sales`
- `Outlet_Establishment_Year`, `Outlet_Size`, `Outlet_Location_Type`
- `Item_Visibility`, `Item_MRP`, `Outlet_Identifier`

## 📈 KPI Metrics

- **Total Sales** – Overall revenue from all items sold.  
- **Average Sales** – Average revenue per item.  
- **Number of Items** – Total number of unique products.  
- **Average Rating** – (If available) Average customer rating for items.
